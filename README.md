* --> This is an EDUCATIONAL application. It's basically a database of countries.
* --> This app is to help people learn more about world's countries.
* --> The users could also help improve the database of the app by adding new countries to the list, updating countries information, and deleting countries from the list.


* The Main class that runs the code and gives the user menu of options to choose from, this class exists in the file XmlWriter.java
* The class Country.java has the attributes: name, population, capital, continent. It also has a setter and a getter to each attribute and a Constructor
* Continent.java is an enum file that contains the available continents which are AFRICA, ASIA, EUROPE, AMERICAS, OCEANIA, and ANTARCTICA. So the user has to write the name of the continent properly.
* countries.xml is a xml file that has all the countries with their info and the info that updates everytime the user makes changes or add countries to the list
* countries1.xml is the original xml file that doesn't change by user input so you can use it for example a reference for comparison purposes.
